          Mackay Hall, placed on the National Register of Historic Places,
          houses the University’s administrative offices, as well as classrooms.
          It was started in 1886 with the help of students who quarried the
          stone from the school’s land, carried it to the site and helped to
          build the structure as a means of earning their tuition. With its
          clock tower overlooking the residence halls, classrooms and other more
          modern facilities around it, Mackay Hall has become the symbol of the
          University.

          Park University offers numerous degree programs online, and it
          maintains a long-standing relationship with the U.S. military for
          which it has been recognized as one of the largest providers of online
          undergraduate education to military learners worldwide. Since 2009,
          Park has received international recognition each year by Military
          Advanced Education magazine as one of its “Top Military-Friendly
          Colleges and Universities,” citing Park’s “innovative academic degree
          programs steeped in excellence.” In addition, in December 2012, Park
          was ranked No. 2 among all private colleges/universities in the
          country as “Best for Vets” by Military Times magazine.
